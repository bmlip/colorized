    "### Prelude \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, we provide a set of exercises that should help you prepare for the exam. There are two sets of exercises: \n",
    "  1. (**5SSB0**). The first set contains questions from previous exams of class 5SSB0 (Adaptive Information Processing). 5SSB0 was last taught at TU/e in the academic year 2018/19. Starting with the academic year 2019/20, the current class (5SSD0) is offered instead. In comparison to 5SSB0, the emphasis of the current class is more on the Bayesian framework, rather than maximum likelihood. Below, we present a selection of exercises that were used in the 5SSB0 exams. While these exercises may not represent the emphasis on Bayesian methods, they do represent the \"style of questions\" and the \"level of difficulty\" that you may expect in upcoming 5SSD0 exams. Also, there is nothing in the questions below that is considered outside the scope of 5SSD0. \n",
    "  2. (**Rehearsal**). A second set of exercises are categorized by lesson headers, e.g., \"Probability Theory\" or \"Generative Classification\". These exercises intend to test you on the contents of the corresponding lesson. Of course, for some exercises you may need some contents of some other (usually earlier) lessons or background materials. A perfect categorization is not feasible, but we've tried to link each question to a lesson so as to make it easier to test yourself after studying a specific lesson.     \n",
    "  \n",
    "- For some of these exercises you will be able to find solutions quickly on the internet. Try to resist this route to solving the problems. You will not be graded for these exercises and solutions will be made available in a separate notebook. **Your ability to solve these exercises without external help provides an excellent indicator of your readiness to pass the exam**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook is still under construction. We will be adding more exercises to help you prepare. Also, not all solutions are provided yet. We are working on this too. If you absolutely need the solution for a problem that doesn't have a solution yet, please contact one of the TAs (see http://bmlip.nl for contact info.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As 2019/20 is the first time we teach this class, please be alert to errors (and let us know if you find any!) or more generally, let us know if things are unclear to you or if a question can be improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We are aware there are some rendering problems in some browsers. We are trying to fix that as well. \n",
    "\n",
