# Content Writing Guide

This guide covers how to write and modify lectures in BMLIP Colorized.

## Markdown Basics

We use Markdown for prose content. Add a new cell, and write:

```julia
md"""
Some **content**.
"""
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl + M`** to quickly add/remove the `md"""` literal.

## Content Structure

### Blocks, Headers, and Quotes
There are many Markdown features to create callouts, code blocks, quotes, lists, etc. The `md"""` macro is from the Julia stdlib Markdown.jl. Read the full list of features here: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/

### Useful Widgets

**PlutoUI.jl** provides:
- `@bind` widgets like sliders
- `details` for collapsible sections ("click to read more")

**PlutoTeachingTools.jl** provides:
- `aside` for placing content in the side margin

## Package Management

Pluto has a built-in package manager that is automatically reproducible. With `using` or `import` you can import any package you want, Pluto will take care of the rest.

## LaTeX and Math

You can use LaTeX in Markdown! Because of conflicts with interpolation, we recommend using backticks:

```julia
md"""
Here is some ``\srt{inline}`` math.

```math
This = \frac{block}{math}
```
"""
```

You can also use `\begin{align}` etc inside a math block.

## Adding Images

The best method is to use GitHub's Issues feature:

1. Open a new issue in any public GitHub repository
2. Drag your image into the writing box
3. Copy the generated image URL
4. Use it in your Markdown:

```julia
md"""
My image:

![some description](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/your-image-id)
"""
```

5. Close the issue (no need to post it)

## HTML in Notebooks

Pluto has first-class support for HTML and JavaScript. You can use HTML cells:

```julia
html"""
<h1>My header</h1>
<p style='color: red;'>This is a paragraph in red.</p>
"""
```

Or use HTML inside Markdown with interpolation:

```julia
md"""
My header:

$(html"<h1>My header</h1>")
"""
```

## Linking

### Linking to a lecture
Go to the **course website**, find the lecture you want to link, and use that URL. For example:

```julia
md"""
Take a look at [the Bayesian Machine Learning lecture](https://bmlip.github.io/course/lectures/Bayesian%20Machine%20Learning.html).
"""
```


### Linking to a specific element in a lecture
Web browsers have a a special feature for linking to specific elements on a page. You can link to a specific element on a web page by adding a `#` followed by the element's ID. An "element" can be anything on a web page: a paragraph, a header, a pluto cell, etc. If it has an ID, you can link to it.

Because Pluto is a web application, this also works in Pluto. 


#### Linking from within a lecture
If you want to link to an element **inside the same notebook**, you can use `#id` as the URL. For example:

```julia
md"""
Take a look at [the function we used here](#remove_last_element).
"""
```

#### Linking from another lecture
If you want to link to an element **inside another notebook**, you can use the full URL of the lecture, and add a `#id` to the element you want to link to. For example:

```julia
md"""
Take a look at [the beta prior from the Bayesian Machine Learning lecture](https://bmlip.github.io/course/lectures/Bayesian%20Machine%20Learning.html#beta-prior).
"""
```

Here the URL consists of two parts, joined together:
```
# the URL
https://bmlip.github.io/course/lectures/Bayesian%20Machine%20Learning.html

# the ID
#beta-prior
```


### Adding IDs to elements

Some elements have IDs by default, but most don't. These have **IDs by default**:
- (since [Pluto 0.20.11, July 2025](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/releases/tag/v0.20.11)) Markdown headers: you can click on the üîó button next to header text to copy a link to the header. When editing a notebook, it gives just the hash: `#Header-text`, and when clicked on a website, it gives the full URL with hash: `https://bmlip.github.io/course/lectures/Bayesian%20Machine%20Learning.html#Header-text`.
- Global variables: a cell that defines `example` will get a linkable ID of `example`. (More on this below.)
- Pluto cells: *(not recommended)* each cell has a unique ID, like `f2a42c4d-9607-4f50-bbda-9a9a4942faab`. You can find it by right-clicking the cell and selecting "Inspect", or you can see it in the Julia source code of the notebook. But this is not the easiest way to do it.

These elements do **not** have IDs by default:
- Markdown headers: `# Dynamic Models` ‚òπÔ∏è
- Markdown paragraphs ‚òπÔ∏è
- Markdown LaTeX equations ‚òπÔ∏è
- Markdown images ‚òπÔ∏è

Because you often do not get an ID by default, you need to add one yourself. There are two easy ways to do this:

#### ID method 1: Global variable
The easiest way to create an ID in Pluto is to define a global variable. In Pluto: If a cell defines a variable `example`, then you can link to it by using `#example` in the URL.

For example:

```julia
function remove_last_element(xs)
    return xs[1:end-1]
end
```

Now you can link to this cell using `#remove_last_element`.


#### ID method 2: Markdown headers
Create a Markdown header (of any level, so `#` or `######` are all valid) and click on the üîó button next to the header text. Requires Pluto 0.20.11 or later.

#### ID method 3: HTML spans
Use HTML spans with IDs for linking:

```julia
md"""
# $(html"<span id=my-header>") My header
This is a paragraph.
"""
```




## Code in Pluto

Pluto has a stricter runtime than Jupyter to ensure reproducibility. Read more about the differences in [this article](https://featured.plutojl.org/basic/pluto%20for%20jupyter%20users).
