# How to make a lecture edit, start to finish
This guide will take you through the process of making a lecture edit, starting from the position of a brand new computer.

## Setup
Install Git (GitHub Desktop), Julia and Pluto. For instructions, see the [Setup Guide](setup.md). Clone the repository to your computer. Open one of the notebooks in Pluto.

After using the instructions to launch Pluto, here is a video of launching a lecture notebook. The path of the `course` folder (previously called `colorized`) will be different on your computer.

*Tip: Use the Status tab to see what is currently busy.*


## Making an edit
Here is a video showing how to make some changes in Pluto. I then switch to GitHub Desktop, where the edits are visible. (Along with a couple small metadata changes, those are fine to commit.) I create a new branch, bring my changes, create a commit, push, publish.
