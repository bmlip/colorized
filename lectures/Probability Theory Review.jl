## üìï Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial

The following is an excerpt from the book [Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/data-analysis-9780198568322) (2006), by D.S. Sivia with J.S. Skilling:

> #### Preface
> "As an undergraduate, I always found the subject of statistics to be rather mysterious. This topic wasn‚Äôt entirely new to me, as we had been taught a little bit about probability earlier at high school; for example, I was already familiar with the binomial, Poisson and normal distributions. Most of this made sense, but only seemed to relate to things like rolling dice, flipping coins, shuffling cards and so on. However, having aspirations of becoming a scientist, what I really wanted to know was how to analyse experimental data. Thus, I eagerly looked forward to the lectures on statistics. Sadly, they were a great disappointment. Although many of the tests and procedures expounded were intuitively reasonable, there was something deeply unsatisfactory about the whole affair: there didn‚Äôt seem to be any underlying basic principles! Hence, the course on ‚Äòprobability and statistics‚Äô had led to an unfortunate dichotomy: probability made sense, but was just a game; statistics was important, but it was a bewildering collection of tests with little obvious rhyme or reason. While not happy with this situation, I decided to put aside the subject and concentrate on real science. After all, the predicament was just a reflection of my own inadequacies and I‚Äôd just have to work at it when the time came to really analyse my data.
> 
> The story above is not just my own, but is the all too common experience of many scientists. Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt have to be like this. What we were not told in our undergraduate lectures is that there is an alternative approach to the whole subject of data analysis which uses only probability theory. In one sense, it makes the topic of statistics entirely superfluous. In another, it provides the logical justification for many of the prevalent statistical tests and procedures, making explicit the conditions and approximations implicitly assumed in their use."


Does this fragment resonate with your own experience? 

In this lesson we introduce *Probability Theory* (PT) again. As we will see in the next lessons, PT is all you need to make sense of machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, etc.

## Propositional (Boolean) Logic 

Define an **event** (or "proposition") ``A`` as a statement that can be considered for its truth by a person. For instance, 

```math
ùê¥= \texttt{``there is life on Mars''}
```

Boolean logic (or propositional logic) is a formal system of logic based on binary truth values: every proposition is either true (with assigned value ``1``) or false (with assigned value ``0``). It is named after George Boole, who developed the algebraic formulation of logic in the mid-19th century.

With Boolean operators (``\lor``, ``\land``, ``\implies``, etc.), we can create and evaluate compound propositions, e.g.,

- Given two events ``A`` and ``B``, the **conjunction** (logical-and) ``A \land B`` is true only if both ``A`` and ``B`` are true. We write ``A \land B`` also shortly as ``A,B`` or ``AB``. 

- The **disjunction** (logical-or) ``A \lor B``, is true if either ``A`` or ``B`` is true or both ``A`` and ``B`` are true. We write ``A \lor B`` also as ``A + B`` (Note that the plus-sign is here not an arithmetic operator, but rather a logical operator to process truth values.)

- The denial of ``A``, i.e., the event **not**-A, is written as ``\bar{A}``. 

Boolean logic provides the rules of inference for **deductive reasoning** and underpins all formal reasoning systems in mathematics and philosophy.

## The Design of Probability Theory

Consider the truth value of the proposition 
```math
ùê¥= \texttt{``there is life on Mars''}
```

with 

```math
I = \texttt{``All known life forms require water''}
```

as background information. Now assume that a new piece of information 

```math
x = \texttt{``There is water on Mars''}
```

becomes available, how **should** our degree of belief in event ``A`` be affected *if we were rational*?

[Richard T. Cox (1946)](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.1990764) developed a **calculus for rational reasoning** about how to represent and update the **degree-of-belief** about the truth value of an event when faced with new information.  

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 3e18c25c-d294-11ef-11bc-a93c2572b107
md"""
In developing this calculus, only some very agreeable assumptions were made, including:

- Degrees of belief are represented by real numbers.

- Plausibility assessments are consistent, e.g.,
  - if ``A`` becomes more plausible under new information ``B``, the assigned degree-of-belief should increase accordingly.
  - If the belief in ``A`` is greater than the belief in ``B``, and the belief in ``B`` is greater than the belief in ``C``, then the belief in ``A`` must be greater than the belief in ``C``.

- Logical equivalences are preserved, e.g., 
  - If the belief in an event can be inferred in two different ways, then the two ways must agree on the resulting belief.

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 3e18d2ea-d294-11ef-35e9-2332dd31dbf0
md"""
Under these assumptions, Cox showed that any consistent system of reasoning about uncertainty must obey the **rules of probability theory** (see [Cox theorem, 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_theorem), and [Caticha, 2012](https://github.com/bertdv/BMLIP/blob/master/lessons/notebooks/files/Caticha-2012-Entropic-Inference-and-the-Foundations-of-Physics.pdf), pp.7-26). These rules are the sum and product rules:

##### The sum rule

- The degree of belief in the disjunction of two events ``A`` and ``B``, with given background information ``I``, is evaluated as

```math
 p(A+B|I) = p(A|I) + p(B|I) - p(A,B|I)
```

##### The product rule: 

- The degree of belief in the conjunction of two events ``A`` and ``B``, with given background information ``I``, is evaluated as

```math
 p(A,B|I) = p(A|B,I)\,p(B|I)
```

Cox‚Äôs Theorem derives the rules of probability theory from first principles, not as arbitrary postulates but as consequences of rational reasoning. 
In other words: **Probability = extended logic**.

## Frequentist vs. Bayesian Interpretation of Probabilities

The interpretation of a probability as a **degree-of-belief** about the truth value of an event is also called the **Bayesian** interpretation.

md"""
In the **Bayesian** interpretation, the probability is associated with a **state-of-knowledge** (usually held by a person, but formally by a rational agent). 

  * For instance, in a coin tossing experiment, ``p(\texttt{outcome} = \texttt{tail}) = 0.4`` should be interpreted as the belief that there is a 40% chance that ``\texttt{tail}`` comes up if the coin were tossed.
  * Under the Bayesian interpretation, PT calculus (sum and product rules) **extends boolean logic to rational reasoning with uncertainty**.

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 4edf38ab-a940-4ab0-be22-fa95cf571146
md"""
In the Bayesian interpretation, all probabilities are, in principle, conditional probabilities of the type ``p(A|I)``, since there is always some background knowledge. However, we often write ``p(A)`` rather than ``p(A|I)`` if the background knowledge ``I`` is assumed to be obviously present. E.g., we usually write ``p(A)`` rather than ``p(\,A\,|\,\text{the-sun-comes-up-tomorrow}\,)``.

"""

md"""
The Bayesian interpretation contrasts with the **frequentist** interpretation of a probability as the relative frequency that an event would occur under repeated execution of an experiment.

  * For instance, if the experiment is tossing a coin, then ``p(\texttt{outcome} = \texttt{tail}) = 0.4`` means that in the limit of a large number of coin tosses, 40% of outcomes turn up as ``\texttt{tail}``.

Using standard statistical methods is like driving a car at night on a poorly lit highway: to keep from going in a ditch, we could build an elaborate system of bumpers and guardrails and equip the car with lane departure warnings and sophisticated navigation systems, and even then we could at best only drive to a few destinations.

## Notational Conventions

Here is a notational convention that you should be precise about (but many authors are not).

If you want to write that a variable ``x`` is distributed as a Gaussian with mean ``\mu`` and covariance matrix ``\Sigma``, you can write this in either of two ways:

```math
\begin{align*} 
p(x) &= \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\Sigma) \\
x &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)
\end{align*}
```

In the second version, the symbol ``\sim`` can be interpreted as "is distributed as" (a Gaussian with parameters ``\mu`` and ``\Sigma``).

Don't write ``p(x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)`` because ``p(x)`` is a function of ``x`` but ``\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)`` is not. 

Also, ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\Sigma)`` is not entirely proper because you already named the argument on the right-hand-site. On the other hand, ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(\cdot|\mu,\Sigma)`` is fine, as is the shorter ``x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)``.

## True and False Events

In probability theory, events that are certainly true or certainly false are treated as special cases of general events, and they correspond to probabilities of ``1`` and ``0``, respectively.

Let ``\Omega`` be the sample space, i.e., the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. Then:
  - The true event corresponds to the entire sample space ``\Omega``.
  - It always happens, regardless of the outcome.
  - Its probability is
```math
p(\Omega) = 1\,.

The false event corresponds to the empty set ``\emptyset``.
  - It never happens (no possible outcomes).
  - Its probability is

p(\emptyset) = 0 \,.

## Independent, Exclusive, and Exhaustive Events

It will be helpful to introduce some terms concerning special relationships between events.  

##### Joint events

The expression ``p(A,B)`` for the probability of the conjuction ``A \land B`` is also called the **joint probability** of events ``A`` and ``B``. Note that 

```math
p(A,B) = p(B,A)\,,
```

since ``A\land B = B \land A``. Therefore, the order of arguments in a joint probability distribution does not matter: ``p(A,B,C,D) = p(C,A,D,B)``, etc.

##### Independent events

Two events ``A`` and ``B`` are said to be **independent** if the probability of one event is not altered by information about the truth of the other event, i.e., 

```math
p(A|B) = p(A)\,.
```

It follows that, if ``A`` and ``B`` are independent, then the product rule simplifies to 

```math
p(A,B) = p(A) p(B)\,.
```

``A`` and ``B`` with given background ``I`` are said to be **conditionally independent** for given ``I``, if 

```math
p(A|B,I) = p(A|I)\,.
```

In that case, the product rule simplifies to ``p(A,B|I) = p(A|I) p(B|I)``.

##### Mutually exclusive events

Two events ``A_1`` and ``A_2`` are said to be **mutually exclusive** ('disjoint') if they cannot be true simultaneously, i.e., if

```math
p(A_1,A_2)=0 \,.
```

For mutually exclusive events, probabilities add (this follows from the sum rule), hence 

```math
p(A_1 + A_2) = p(A_1) + p(A_2)
```

##### Collectively exhaustive events

A set of events ``A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N`` is said to be **collectively exhaustive** if one of the statements is necessarily true, i.e., ``A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_N=\mathrm{TRUE}``, or equivalently 

```math
p(A_1+A_2+\cdots +A_N) = 1 \,.
```

##### Partitioning the universe

If a set of events ``A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n`` is both **mutually exclusive** and **collectively exhaustive**, then we say that they **partition the universe**. Technically, this means that 

```math
\sum_{n=1}^N p(A_n) = p(A_1 + \ldots + A_N) = 1
```

## Marginalization

Let ``A`` and ``B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_n`` be events, where ``B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_n`` partitions the universe. Then

```math
\sum_{i=1}^n p(A,B_i) = p(A) \,.
```

This rule is called the [law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability). Proof:

```math
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i p(A,B_i) &= p(\sum_i AB_i)  &&\quad \text{(since all $AB_i$ are disjoint)}\\
  &= p(A,\sum_i B_i) \\
  &= p(A,\Omega) &&\quad \text{($\Omega$ is true event, since $B_i$ are exhaustive)} \\
  &= p(A)

## Bayes Rule Nomenclature

Some nomenclature associated with Bayes rule:

```math
\underbrace{p(\theta | D)}_{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{p(D|\theta)}^{\text{likelihood}} \times \overbrace{p(\theta)}^{\text{prior}}}{\underbrace{p(D)}_{\text{evidence}}}
```

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 3e1c0e80-d294-11ef-0d19-375e01988f16
md"""
Note that the evidence (a.k.a. *marginal likelihood* ) can be computed from the numerator through marginalization since

```math
 p(D) = \int p(D,\theta) \,\mathrm{d}\theta = \int p(D|\theta)\,p(\theta) \,\mathrm{d}\theta
```

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 3e1c1e3e-d294-11ef-0955-bdf9d0ba3c53
md"""
Hence, having access to likelihood and prior is in principle sufficient to compute both the evidence and the posterior. To emphasize that point, Bayes rule is sometimes written as a transformation:

```math
 \underbrace{\underbrace{p(\theta|D)}_{\text{posterior}}\cdot \underbrace{p(D)}_{\text{evidence}}}_{\text{this is what we want to compute}} = \underbrace{\underbrace{p(D|\theta)}_{\text{likelihood}}\cdot \underbrace{p(\theta)}_{\text{prior}}}_{\text{this is available}}
```

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 3e1c4224-d294-11ef-2707-49470aaae6eb
md"""
For a given data set ``D``, the posterior probabilities of the parameters scale relatively against each other as

```math
p(\theta|D) \propto p(D|\theta) p(\theta)
```

Hence, all that we can learn from the observed data is contained in the likelihood function ``p(D|\theta)``. This is called the **likelihood principle**.

## Probabilistic Inference

**Probabilistic inference** refers to computing

```math
p(\,\text{whatever-we-want-to-know}\, | \,\text{whatever-we-already-know}\,)
```

For example: 

```math
\begin{align*}
 p(\,\text{Mr.S.-killed-Mrs.S.} \;&|\; \text{he-has-her-blood-on-his-shirt}\,) \\
 p(\,\text{transmitted-codeword} \;&|\;\text{received-codeword}\,) 
  \end{align*}
```

This can be accomplished by repeatedly applying the sum and product rules.

In particular, consider a joint distribution ``p(X,Y,Z)``. Assume we are interested in ``p(X|Z)``:

```math
\begin{align*}
p(X|Z) \stackrel{p}{=} \frac{p(X,Z)}{p(Z)} \stackrel{s}{=} \frac{\sum_Y p(X,Y,Z)}{\sum_{X,Y} p(X,Y,Z)} \,,
\end{align*}
```

where the ``s`` and ``p`` above the equality sign indicate whether the sum or product rule was used. 

In the rest of this course, we'll encounter many lengthy probabilistic derivations. For each manipulation, you should be able to associate an 's' (for sum rule), a 'p' (for product or Bayes rule) or an 'm' (for a simplifying model assumption like conditional independency) above any equality sign.

##### Solution 

- The given information is ``p(D=1)=0.01``, ``p(T=1|D=1)=0.95`` and ``p(T=0|D=0)=0.85``. We are asked to derive ``p( D=1 | T=1)``. We just follow the sum and product rules to derive the requested probability:

```math
\begin{align*}
p( D=1 &| T=1) \\
&\stackrel{p}{=} \frac{p(T=1,D=1)}{p(T=1)} \\
&\stackrel{p}{=} \frac{p(T=1|D=1)p(D=1)}{p(T=1)} \\
&\stackrel{s}{=} \frac{p(T=1|D=1)p(D=1)}{p(T=1|D=1)p(D=1)+p(T=1|D=0)p(D=0)} \\
&= \frac{0.95\times$(specificity)}{0.95\times0.01 + 0.15\times0.99} = 0.0601
\end{align*}
```


Note that ``p(\text{sick}|\text{positive test}) = 0.06`` while ``p(\text{positive test} | \text{sick}) = 0.95``. This is a huge difference that is sometimes called the "medical test paradox" or the [base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). 

Many people have trouble distinguishing ``p(A|B)`` from ``p(B|A)`` in their heads. This has led to major negative consequences. For instance, unfounded convictions in the legal arena and numerous unfounded conclusions in the pursuit of scientific results. See [Ioannidis (2005)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) and [Clayton (2021)](https://aubreyclayton.com/bernoulli).

Consider a distribution ``p(x)``. The first moment, also known as **expected value** or **mean** of ``p(x)`` is defined as

Consider an arbitrary distribution ``p(X)`` with mean ``\mu_x`` and variance ``\Sigma_x`` and the linear transformation

$(challenge_header("Sampling Distribution and Likelihood Function for the Coin Toss", challenge_text="Code Example:"))


Consider the following simple model for the outcome ``y \in \{0,1\}`` (tail = ``0``, head = ``1``) of a biased coin toss with a real parameter ``\theta \in [0,1]``:

```math
\begin{align*}
p(y|\theta) = \theta^y (1-\theta)^{1-y}\\
\end{align*}
```

Next, we use Julia to plot both the sampling distribution 

```math
p(y|\theta=0.5) = \begin{cases} 0.5 & \text{if }y=0 \\ 0.5 & \text{if } y=1 \end{cases}
```

and the likelihood function 

```math
L(\theta) \triangleq p(y=1|\theta) = \theta \,.
```

$(challenge_header("Bag Counter"; challenge_text="Inference Exercise:"))

##### Problem  

- A bag contains one ball, known to be either white or black. A white ball is put in, the bag is shaken. Next, a ball is drawn out, which proves to be white. What is now the  chance of drawing a white ball?

##### Solution 

- Again, use Bayes and marginalization to arrive at ``p(\text{white}|\text{data})=2/3``, see the [Exercises](https://nbviewer.org/github/bertdv/BMLIP/blob/master/lessons/exercises/Exercises-Probability-Theory-Review.ipynb) notebook.

##### Problem 

- A dark bag contains five red balls and seven green ones. 
  - (a) What is the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw? 
- Balls are not returned to the bag after each draw. 
  - (b) If you know that on the second draw the ball was a green one, what is now the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw?

##### Solution 

- (a) ``5/12``. (b) ``5/11``, see the [Exercises](https://nbviewer.org/github/bertdv/BMLIP/blob/master/lessons/exercises/Exercises-Probability-Theory-Review.ipynb) notebook.


``\Rightarrow`` Again, we conclude that conditional probabilities reflect **implications for a state of knowledge** rather than temporal causality.

$(challenge_header("Sum of Two Gaussian-distributed Variables"; big=true, challenge_text="Code Example:", header_level=2))  

Consider two independent Gaussian-distributed variables ``X`` and ``Y`` (see [wikipedia normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) for definition of a Gaussian (=Normal) distribution):

```math
\begin{align*}
p_X(x) &= \mathcal{N}(\,x\,|\,\mu_X,\sigma_X^2\,) \\ 
p_Y(y) &= \mathcal{N}(\,y\,|\,\mu_Y,\sigma_Y^2\,) 
\end{align*}
```

Let ``Z = X + Y``. Performing the convolution (nice exercise) yields a Gaussian PDF for ``Z``: 

```math
p_Z(z) = \mathcal{N}(\,z\,|\,\mu_X+\mu_Y,\sigma_X^2+\sigma_Y^2\,).
```

We illustrate the distributions for ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` using Julia:

$(challenge_header("Transformation of a Gaussian Variable"; big=true, challenge_text="Example:", header_level=2))  

Let ``p_x(x) = \mathcal{N}(x|\mu,\sigma^2)`` and ``y = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}``. 

##### Problem

- What is ``p_y(y)``? 

##### Solution

- Note that ``h(x)`` is invertible with ``x = g(y) = \sigma y + \mu``. The change-of-variable formula leads to

```math
\begin{align*}
p_y(y) &= p_x(g(y)) \cdot g^\prime(y) \\
  &= p_x(\sigma y + \mu) \cdot \sigma \\
  &= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt(2 \pi)} \exp\left( - \frac{(\sigma y + \mu - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \cdot \sigma \\
  &=  \frac{1}{\sqrt(2 \pi)} \exp\left( - \frac{y^2 }{2}\right)\\
  &= \mathcal{N}(y|0,1) 
\end{align*}
```

In the statistics literature, ``y = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}`` is called the **standardized** variable since it transforms a general normal variable into a standard normal one.
