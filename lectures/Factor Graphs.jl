## Why Factor Graphs?


A probabilistic inference task derives most of its computational complexity from the need to perform marginalization, i.e., integrating (or summing) over latent or nuisance variables. 

For example, for a model ``p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)``, the inference task ``p(x_2|x_3)`` involves computing

```math
p(x_2|x_3) = \frac{p(x_2,x_3)}{p(x_3)} = \frac{\int \cdots \int p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) \, \mathrm{d}x_1  \mathrm{d}x_4 \mathrm{d}x_5}{\int \cdots \int p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) \, \mathrm{d}x_1  \mathrm{d}x_2 \mathrm{d}x_4 \mathrm{d}x_5}
```

Because marginalization operations (sums or integrals) scale poorly with the number of variables, a phenomenon known as the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), we must often leverage the model’s conditional independence structure to reduce computational complexity and obtain feasible inference procedures.

Factor graphs provide a computationally efficient approach to solving inference problems **if the probabilistic model can be factorized**.

 $(HTML("<span id='factorization-helps'>Factorization helps.</span>")) For instance, if ``p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = p(x_1)p(x_2,x_3)p(x_4)p(x_5|x_4)``, then

```math
\begin{align}
p(x_2|x_3) &= \frac{\int \cdots \int p(x_1)p(x_2,x_3)p(x_4)p(x_5|x_4) \, \mathrm{d}x_1  \mathrm{d}x_4 \mathrm{d}x_5}{\int \cdots \int p(x_1)p(x_2,x_3)p(x_4)p(x_5|x_4) \, \mathrm{d}x_1  \mathrm{d}x_2 \mathrm{d}x_4 \mathrm{d}x_5} \\
  &= \frac{p(x_2,x_3)}{\int p(x_2,x_3) \mathrm{d}x_2}
\end{align}
```

which is computationally much cheaper than the general case above.

In this lesson, we discuss how computationally efficient inference in *factorized* probability distributions can be automated by message passing-based inference in factor graphs.

The constraint ``f_=(x,x^\prime,x^{\prime\prime})`` enforces that ``x=x^\prime=x^{\prime\prime}`` **for every valid configuration**.

Since ``f`` is a marginal of ``g``, i.e.,

## Terminating an FGG

Consider a model 

```math
f(x_1,x_2,y) = f_a(x_1) f_b(x_1,x_2,y) \,.
```

In this model, the variables ``x_2`` and ``y`` appear in only one factor. In the corresponding FFG, edges that only connect to one factor are called a **half-edges**. Half-edges typically represent inputs or outputs of the graph, such as observed variables and external control signals.

In general, any half-edge can be terminated by a node ``f(\cdot) = 1``, since the model

```math
f_a(x_1) f_b(x_1,x_2,y) \underbrace{f_c(y)}_{=1} \underbrace{f_d(x_2)}_{=1}\,,
```
is the same model as ``f_a(x_1) f_b(x_1,x_2,y)``.


![](https://github.com/bmlip/course/blob/v2/assets/figures/ffg-terminal-node.png?raw=true)

An FFG without half-edges is called a Terminated FFG (TFFG).

Due to the factorization of ``f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_7)`` and the [Generalized Distributive Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_distributive_law), we can decompose the marginalization operation to the following product-of-sums:

```math
\begin{align*}
\bar{f}(x_3) = 
  &\underbrace{ \Bigg( \sum_{x_1,x_2} \underbrace{f_a(x_1)}_{\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_1}(x_1)}\, \underbrace{f_b(x_2)}_{\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_2}(x_2)}\,f_c(x_1,x_2,x_3)\Bigg) }_{\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)} \\

which, in case ``x_i`` has ``10`` values, requires a few hundred additions and is therefore computationally (much!) lighter than executing the full sum ``\sum_{x_1,\ldots,x_7}f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_7)``

Note that the intermediate result ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)`` is obtained by multiplying all enclosed factors (``f_a``, ``f_b, f_c``) by the red dashed box, followed by marginalization (summing) over all enclosed variables (``x_1``, ``x_2``),

```math

This operation is known as **Closing-the-Box**. The result is a new **composite node** that holds the factor ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)``, and is visually represented by the red dashed box in the factor graph. The composite node ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)`` depends only on the variable(s) that cross the boundary of the box (in this case ``x_3``) and effectively replaces the internal subgraph contained within the red box.

The Closing-the-box operation can alternatively be interpreted as **passing a message** from the newly created composite node to the rest of the graph. For instance, ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)`` can be understood in two equivalent ways: 
  * as a factor associated with the composite node that encloses the subgraph inside the red box.
  * as a message sent from this composite node to the variable ``x_3``. 

In both interpretations, the internal details of the subgraph are abstracted away, and the composite node effectively summarizes its contribution to the overall inference process.

The complete inference process for computing ``\bar{f}(x_3)`` can be interpreted as a **message passing process**. It begins by sending messages from the terminal nodes and proceeds by propagating messages through the internal nodes of the factor graph. This continues until both the forward and backward messages for ``x_3`` have been computed. The final result, ``\bar{f}(x_3)``, is obtained by multiplying the forward and backward messages,

```math
\bar{f}(x_3) = \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3) \cdot \overleftarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)

This message-based interpretation enables modular, local inference that scales efficiently with the structure of the factor graph.

## Sum-Product Messages

Let's continue with the message passing interpretation of inference in an FFG. Closing the red box around ``f_a``, ``f_b`` and ``f_c`` leads to an outgoing message ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)`` for node ``f_c``, given by

```math
\begin{align}
\underbrace{\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_3}(x_3)}_{\substack{ \text{outgoing} \\ \text{message} }} 
&= \sum_{x_1}\sum_{x_2} \underbrace{\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_1}(x_1) \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X_2}(x_2)}_{\substack{\text{incoming} \\ \text{messages}}} \underbrace{f_c(x_1,x_2,x_3)}_{\text{factor}}

If the factor graph for the whole model has no cycles, i.e., the FFG is a tree, then the process of passing SP message from the terminal nodes to the internal (latent) variables yields exact Bayesian marginals for all hidden variables. This inference method is known as the **Sum-Product** (SP) algorithm.

However, if the graph contains cycles, one can conceptually view the graph as an infinite tree by “unrolling” the cycles. In this loopy setting, SP-based inference is not guaranteed to yield exact marginals. Nevertheless, in practice, if we run the SP algorithm for a limited number of iterations (i.e., a finite unrolling), we often obtain high-quality approximate marginals that are sufficient for many inference tasks.

Given incoming messages ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{X}(x)`` and ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{Y}(y)``, the outgoing SP message ``\overrightarrow{\mu}_{Z}(z)`` to edge ``z`` is given by
```math
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{\mu}_{Z}(z) &= \iint  \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X}(x) \overrightarrow{\mu}_{Y}(y) \,\delta(z-x)\delta(z-y) \,\mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y \\
   &=  \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X}(z)  \int  \overrightarrow{\mu}_{Y}(y) \,\delta(z-y) \,\mathrm{d}y \\
   &=  \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X}(z) \overrightarrow{\mu}_{Y}(z) 
\end{align*}
```

By symmetry, this also implies (for the same equality node) that

```math
\begin{align*}
\overleftarrow{\mu}_{X}(x) &= \overrightarrow{\mu}_{Y}(x) \overleftarrow{\mu}_{Z}(x) \\
\overleftarrow{\mu}_{Y}(y) &= \overrightarrow{\mu}_{X}(y) \overleftarrow{\mu}_{Z}(y)\,.
\end{align*}
```

It follows that message passing through an equality node is analogous to applying Bayes’ rule: two information sources are fused by multiplying their corresponding probability distributions.

## Automating Bayesian Inference by Message Passing

The foregoing message update rules can be worked out in closed-form and put into tables (e.g., see Tables 1 through 6 in [Loeliger (2007)](https://github.com/bmlip/course/blob/main/assets/files/Loeliger-2007-The-factor-graph-approach-to-model-based-signal-processing.pdf) for many standard factors such as essential probability distributions and operations such as additions, fixed-gain multiplications and branching (equality nodes).

In the optional slides below, we have worked out a few more update rules for the [addition node](#sp-for-addition-node) and the [multiplication node](#sp-for-multiplication-node).

If the update rules for all node types in a graph have been tabulated, then inference by message passing comes down to executing a set of table-lookup operations, thus creating a completely **automatable Bayesian inference framework**. 

In our research lab [BIASlab](http://biaslab.org) (FLUX 7.060), we are developing [RxInfer](http://rxinfer.com), which is a (Julia) toolbox for automating Bayesian inference by message passing in a factor graph.

In general, a code package that automates Bayesian inference is called a [Probabilistic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming) Language (PLL). RxInfer is a PLL that automates inference through message passing-based inference in a factor graph.

## Final thoughts: Modularity and Abstraction

The great Michael Jordan (no, not [this one](https://youtu.be/cuLprHh_BRg), but [this one](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/)), wrote:   

> "I basically know of two principles for treating complicated systems in simple ways: the first is the principle of **modularity** and the second is the principle of **abstraction**. I am an apologist for computational probability in machine learning because I believe that probability theory implements these two principles in deep and intriguing ways — namely through factorization and through averaging. Exploiting these two mechanisms as fully as possible seems to me to be the way forward in machine learning." — Michael Jordan, 1997 (quoted in [Fre98](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262062022/)).

Factor graphs capture these ideas elegantly—both visually and computationally.

**Visually**, the graph structure displays the modularity of conditional independencies in the model. Each node encapsulates internal complexity, and by closing the box, we can hierarchically move to higher levels of abstraction.

**Computationally**, message-passing inference exploits the distributive law to avoid unnecessary computations.

Although RxInfer is still under active development, my prediction is that within 5–10 years, RxInfer—or a comparable toolbox—will be able to automate Bayesian inference for virtually any interesting probabilistic model you can conceive. In principle, you will then have all the tools needed to implement the four-step Bayesian ML recipe—model specification, parameter learning, model evaluation, and application—for any (Bayesian) information processing problem.

```

This is a linear system with only Gaussian source signals (``w_k`` and ``v_k``), hence the distributions for ``z_k`` and ``x_k`` will also be Gaussian. As a result, we only need to compute the mean and covariance matrix. We begin with the mean for ``p(z_k|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w)``:


```math
\begin{align*}
  E[z_k|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w] &= E[A z_{k-1} + w_k|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w] \\
  &= E[A z_{k-1}|z_{k-1},A] + E[w_k|\Sigma_w] \\
  &= A z_{k-1} + 0
  \end{align*}
```

And now the variance:


```math
\begin{align*}
  V[z_k|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w] &= E[(z_k - E[z_k])(z_k-E[z_k])^T \,|\,z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w ] \\ &= E[(\overbrace{A z_{k-1} + w_k}^{z_k} - \overbrace{A z_{k-1}}^{E[z_k]})(A z_{k-1} + w_k-A z_{k-1})^T|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w] \\
  &= E[w_k w_k^T|\Sigma_w] \\
  &= \Sigma_w
  \end{align*}
```

You can execute similar computations for the other distributions, leading to


```math
\begin{align*}
 p(z_k|z_{k-1},A,\Sigma_w) &= \mathcal{N}(z_k|A z_{k-1},\Sigma_w) \\
 p(x_k|z_k,C,\Sigma_v) &= \mathcal{N}(x_k|C z_k,\Sigma_v) \\

```math
\begin{align*}

## Example: Sum-Product Algorithm to infer a posterior

Consider a generative model 

```math
p(x,y_1,y_2) = p(x)\,p(y_1|x)\,p(y_2|x) .
```

This model expresses the assumption that ``Y_1`` and ``Y_2`` are independent measurements of ``X``.

## Code for Sum-Product Algorithm to infer  a posterior

We'll use RxInfer to build the above graph, and perform sum-product message passing to infer the posterior ``p(x|y_1,y_2)``. We assume ``p(y_1|x)`` and ``p(y_2|x)`` to be Gaussian likelihoods with known variances:

```math
\begin{align*}
    p(y_1\,|\,x) &= \mathcal{N}(y_1\,|\,x, v_{y1}) \\
    p(y_2\,|\,x) &= \mathcal{N}(y_2\,|\,x, v_{y2})
\end{align*}
```

Under this model, the posterior is given by:

```math
\begin{align*}
    p(x\,|\,y_1,y_2) &\propto \overbrace{p(y_1\,|\,x)\,p(y_2\,|\,x)}^{\text{likelihood}}\,\overbrace{p(x)}^{\text{prior}} \\
    &=\mathcal{N}(x\,|\,\hat{y}_1, v_{y1})\, \mathcal{N}(x\,|\,\hat{y}_2, v_{y2}) \, \mathcal{N}(x\,|\,m_x, v_x) 
\end{align*}
```

so we can validate the answer by solving the Gaussian multiplication manually.
