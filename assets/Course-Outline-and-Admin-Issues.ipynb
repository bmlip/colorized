    "- Suppose you need to develop an algorithm for a complex DSP task, e.g., a speech recognition engine. This is what you'll do:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Choose a set of candidate algorithms $y=H_k(x;\\theta)$ where $k \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,K\\}$ and $\\theta \\in \\Theta_k$; (you think that) there's an algorithm $H_{k^*}(x;\\theta^*)$  that performs according to your liking. \n",
    "  2. You collect a set of examples $D=\\{(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\ldots,(x_N,y_N)\\}$ that are consistent with the correct algorithm behavior.\n",

    "\n",

    "  2. **parameter estimation**, i.e., find $\\theta^*$ \n",
    "\n",

    "  3. The [Piazza course site](https://piazza.com/class/kgp8llbdmx84s9) will be used for Q&A and communication.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Students are expected to contribute (together) to an answer at the Piazza site. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The regularly scheduled live meetings are mainly there to check up on progress or issues that are better discussed live than at Piazza. I want to avoid 2-hour video lectures. \n",

    "  - You can also access Piazza from the Canvas website (in Navigation menu) or through the course homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept—you can even do so anonymously.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The tested material consists of the lecture notes (+ reading assignments as assigned in the first cell/slide of each lecture notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to prepare for the exam, I **highly recommend** that you also watch the video guides, read the Q&A at Piazza and do the [Exercises](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bertdv/BMLIP/blob/master/lessons/exercises/Exercises.ipynb).\n",

Also accessible from course homepage.\n",

    "- (BONUS POINTS!). In principle, the written exam determines 100% of your grade. If (and only if) your final score is between 5.0 and 5.4 (which would round to a failing grade 5), then I may use your contribution statistics at Piazza to upgrade your score to 5.5 (which would round to a passing grade 6).\n",
    "  - This is meant as an incentive to become an active contributor to the Piazza Q&A.\n",
    "  - The judgement on whether your Piazza participation warrants lifting your score to 5.5 is a subjective decision that I will make.\n",
    "  - You should be a more-than-average contributor to get bonus points from your Piazza inputs.\n"
